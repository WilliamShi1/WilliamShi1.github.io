Question:
Explains how interface relates to the design principles learned in class, how data is
passed down through your components, how user interactions can trigger changes in the state of components, and the overall goal and value of the application to a user.


Answer:
All components are well distributed in the middle of the page and I used a table with the header including Picture, Name, Model and Price to store each car model's information clearly, so that the viewers can better understand the product. Everything are aligned and the design pattern is balanced and neat. 

All data are hard coded and each model is stored as an object in the array in App.js. In the FilterList.jsx, the data will be filtered based on the user's selection. In the List.jsx, each model's data is formatted as HTML table. 

In my webpage, there are 2 types of filter categories, model type and price range, and 1 sorting method by sorting the price in ascending order or descending order. For each selection, the items will be filtered by calling the setState. 

My overall goal is to provide the straightforward information and car images to the viewers and help them to make the best decision in a short time by evaluating the different model types and prices. Since my neat and balanced webpage design, it will definitely bring the best desirable user experience to our users, which mean it bring the positive value of the application to users.
